# This file contains the default configuration used by Weaver.
#
# Weaver allows local configuration for a particular target as well as global
# configuration. It looks for configuration files in the target directory, the
# parent directory (i.e., the directory containing all the targets), the
# `$HOME/.weaver/weaver.yaml` directory, and finally in the
# `defaults/weaver_config` directory (embedded in the Weaver binary). A local
# definition overrides the corresponding definition that may be present in the
# parent directory, which itself may redefine the corresponding entry in the
# home directory (i.e., defined per user), and finally in the Weaver application
# binary (i.e., defined by Weaver authors). With this structure, we can specify
# configuration per target, for all targets, and even reuse a configuration
# defined in the binary of the Weaver application.
